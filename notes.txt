=== Dedicated system

For my client who has a restricted computing system, I have a dedicated sub-system.  I use an IMAP folder based approach.  This is great because they have a secure, remote email access system that then lets me access my stuff from anywhere.  I use the following folder structure:

├── @actions
│   └── deferred
├── @projects
│   └── tickler
└── @waiting

Note that this does not distinguish any of the various contexts that I might have for other clients or for myself.  This is because I choose to keep this system very simple.  As a result, I need to be especially careful to limit the number of next actions to an absolute minimum, which is not too hard because things are typically so frantic there that only one or two things are worked until their conclusion and then other things are selected.
